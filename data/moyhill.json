        "Each Friday (in harvest season) morning, we - those living and working at moy hill farm - get up extra early for the harvest. By mid afternoon the work is done; our timber packing shed full of amazing, healing, potent vegetables. 50 families will receive a box each; more will change hands at the market.", 
        "Our mission is to feed local people, love earth and inspire. To progress in that direction we have and continue to work with whatever is necessary - soil, seeds, shovels and long days in the field; farmers, banks, politics (Fergal stood for election last year), NGOs, charities, schools and universities; as well as yoga, meditation, non-violent communication and community building practices. We grow food but also hold an open door for anyone to stay, work, learn, grow, heal."

<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>
CSA Network Ireland is the national network for CSA farms, and aims to
support and promote the activities of CSAs in Ireland. The Network
helps to organise an annual meeting for all CSAs in Ireland to come
together to share knowledge, experiences and to get to know each
other. This is hosted at a different CSA each year and all members of the
CSAs around Ireland are encouraged to come along.
</p>
<p>
Our members care about good healthy food, sustainable practices, and
having a community at our dinner table. We believe that the CSA model
is truly powerful. It empowers both farmers and communities to be
actively engaged in their local food system. Our dream is to see a CSA in
every neighbourhood all over the island, having a significant impact on
creating a more just and agroecological food system that would
transform how people in Ireland engage with farming.
</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>
The Network was founded on 23 September 2015. A number of
newly-formed CSA farms in Ireland recognised the benefits of sharing
resources and supporting each other. The founding farms participated in
the research behind the European Overview of Community Supported
Agriculture. We are an all-island network.
</p>
<h2>The structure of our network</h2>
<p>
The network is maintained on a voluntary basis. Each member farm nominates
a representative to liaise with the network coordinator. See the Farm Profiles
page for more information on some of the members.
</p>
<p>
We meet every six months for a semi-formal discussion. We prefer to
communicate in person, to visit each other's farms and to talk
face-to-face rather than to rely too heavily on authoritative procedures.
Information is disseminated orally, like folklore, and by learning through
practice. Human relationships are key.
</p>
<p>
There is no fee to join the network, however member farms make a donation
to cover our membership fee with the international network of CSAs, Urgenci.
The farmers are personally known to each other and membership is based on
friendship and trust. The members of the CSA Network of Ireland endorse the
European CSA Declaration.
</p>
<h2>Our aims and objectives</h2>
<ol>
<li>
Use the network to support up-and-coming CSAs both
producer- and consumer-driven
</li>
<li>
Share ideas on a range of issues surrounding the set-up and
running of a CSA from finding producers/land to distribution of
shares / logistics
</li>
<li>
Create a database of existing CSAs on the island for the
purpose of those seeking to join a CSA
</li>
<li>
Investigate ways in which to promote the growth of CSA
in Ireland
</li>
<li>
Link up with other groups/organisations working along
the same lines (Urgenci, Land Workers Alliance...)
</li>
<li>
Establish a platform for producers to share information,
organise farm visits and group work-days, buy in bulk, share
surplus produce etc
</li>
<li>
Host events to raise awareness, provide a social melting pot for
the members of different CSAs to meet, swap recipes, get ideas
and provide mutual support
</li>

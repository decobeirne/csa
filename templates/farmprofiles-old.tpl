Community Supported Farms improve the quality and quantity of food available locally while reducing
the environmental impact of producing this food. Our farm is co-owned by the members. Members pay a
regular contribution to cover administration, running costs and wages of our growers. In return we
all receive a regular supply of farm fresh vegetables in season, delivered 3 times a week to a central
collection point. We also arrange regular farm walks, as well as training and educational events. If
you can collect your produce in Cloughjordan, you’re eligible to be a member – it's as simple as that!
Our pricing structure means being a member and sharing all this quality produce is affordable for
everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
The farmers are Pat Malone and Kevin Dudley, helped by woofers. Pat Malone
graduated from Horticulture College in 1989 and began his own commercial enterprise as a conventional
vegetable grower. After ten years it was clear to him that this way of farming was too hard on the
land and intense on the soul. He took a career break and spent six years working with Irish Seeds
Savers Association as a researcher and collector of heritage fruit trees, mainly apples. There he
deepened his love and understanding of the natural rhythms and cycles of nature. He also developed
a passion and fascination with the world of Bio Dynamics and later with horses. He moved to
Cloughjordan in 2007 and was instrumental in setting up the community farm. Then, having completed
his own house build in the ecovillage he took over as field scale vegetable farmer in 2011.

Derrybeg farm uses a certain CSA model where the farmer
works the land and the consumers become members of the
farm, committing to pay in advance a certain amount of
money, for an agreed period of time. The members’ money
provides a modest income for the farmer and covers the
day-to-day running costs of the farm. In return, the members
receive food, usually a box of vegetables per week with
occasional options for eggs and meat. Various grants and
fundraising events are another source of income for the
farm. It also has social members that pay a nominal fee to
avail of the social aspects of the farm but not receive its
produce. There is a steering group of six people (including
the farmer) who represent the membership in overseeing the
overall planning and logistics of the organisation. Alongside
growing a wide variety of organic vegetables the farm also
rears pigs and ducks. Members and volunteers help the
farmer with his work on a regular basis. The farm holds
various social, cultural and educational events such as music
sessions, pot-luck food lunches, bonfires, creative art
instalments, and biodiversity talks and activities. Nathan
Jackson is the farmer. The land is rented from Kildare
County Council on a short-term lease.

Dublin CSA has been created in 2012 by a few people passionate about community farming. Since it has started,
Seamus, our primary farmer, has been growing vegetables for Dublin CSA, itself growing from about 10 to 35
members today.
            </p>
            <p>
We offer full share (weekly collection) or half share (bi-weekly collection) from June to February, each
collection including 5 varieties in average. Seamus bring the vegetables to Smithfield on Thursdays between
18:30 and 19:00 and as we aim to reduce packaging, members are expected to come with their own bag/container.
            </p>
            <p>
For us, CSA is more than a way to feed you with healthy, natural and local food. It is commitment, learning
and community engagement. Members voluntarily carry out the coordination of the CSA (membership,
communication, events). Throughout the season, there are also additional and entirely voluntary opportunities
to get to know fellow members better and have fun on the farm.
            </p>
            <p>
With our project at Seamus’s farm, we try to find out how to make it practical for us, how to make it work.
It is an ongoing process of learning, experiencing and discovering

Our CSA has been running since 2015.  Our season runs from June until December.  We also sell in
the Loughrea market on Thursday mornings during the season and supply Loam restaurant in Galway
year-round.

Growing food takes time, effort and plenty of work but we’ve been building slowly and steadily
since we first started the farm in 2012.

            <p>
Our aim is to produce healthy and affordable food for the local community and assure a livelihood
for ourselves – we are also interested in fruit production and have an orchard for apples as well
as a soft fruit area.

Each Friday (in harvest season) morning, we - those living and working at moy hill farm - get up extra early for the
harvest. By mid afternoon the work is done; our timber packing shed full of amazing, healing, potent vegetables. 50
families will receive a box each; more will change hands at the market. Our mission is to feed local people, love earth
and inspire. To progress in that direction we have and continue to work with whatever is necessary - soil, seeds, shovels
and long days in the field; farmers, banks, politics (Fergal stood for election last year), NGOs, charities, schools
and universities; as well as yoga, meditation, non-violent communication and community building practices. We grow
food but also hold an open door for anyone to stay, work, learn, grow, heal.

Skerries Community Harvest Group (CHG) was launched by Sustainable Skerries in North County Dublin.
This is a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) scheme. It is a partnership between the people and
the grower where we all work together to provide healthy, local food for our families and our
community. This partnership allows us to share both the rewards and also the challenges that
our independent farmers face every year. CSAs are a relatively new concept in Ireland but they
have been working wonderfully in USA, Canada and in Europe for many years. By joining, we as
members become a part of where our food comes from. Each member pays a set monthly fee, and in
return you receive a weekly box of locally grown, freshly picked organic vegetables. As a member
you can also visit the farm on Member’s Day to walk the land, learn about the vegetables being
grown or even  help with the harvest. A newsletter is sent out regularly keeping you involved
in the daily happenings on the farm and recipes. By forming CSA’s we strenghten our community’s
links to the land. The CSA allows everyone the opportunity to have access to a resilient, local
and healthy food supply.
